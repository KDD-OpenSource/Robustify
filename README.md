Code for our Paper "Post-Robustifying Deep Anomaly Detection Ensembles by Model Selection"

"Model_training" contains the code for generating the anomaly detectors used for this Paper.
Also take a look at DEANs Code here: https://github.com/DEAN-ADML/DEAN

"Model_verification" contains the code for verifying the given models.
This also requires Marabou: https://github.com/NeuralNetworkVerification/Marabou

All code still subject to refactoring.
